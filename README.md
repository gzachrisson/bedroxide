## What is Bedroxide?

Bedroxide is intended to eventually become a basic Minecraft Bedrock server written in Rust.

## But why?

I have been interested in learning Rust for some time and I couldn't find any Minecraft Bedrock server written in Rust yet. This seemed like a project that would make a good fit for Rust and more than complicated enough to keep me interested and busy for a long time.

## Can I help?

Pull requests are more than welcome!

Look at the [Getting Started](https://github.com/gzachrisson/bedroxide/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page to get up and running.
