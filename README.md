# Bedroxide

## What is Bedroxide?

Bedroxide is intended to eventually become a basic Minecraft Bedrock server written in Rust.

## But why?

I have been interested in learning Rust for some time and since I couldn't find any Minecraft Bedrock server written in Rust yet. So this seemed like a project that would make a good fit for Rust and more than complicated enough to keep me interested.

## Can I help?

Pull requests are more than welcome!
